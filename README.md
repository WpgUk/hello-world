Hi everybody

I am here to learn as much as i can, my interests are phone/tablet/pc repairs --- Networks and cyber security --- webdeign and development --- programming and software developement --- Muay Thai, K1/Dutch Kickboxing, Boxing and weight training. as a rough guide anyway :) 
I have touched on all aspects but I am a novice and have much to learn and hopefully one day to pass on to the next novices starting their journey.
